  abstract     = {Private Information Retrieval ({PIR}) allows a client to privately retrieve some data from a public database. There exist two types of {PIR}: (computational) Single-server {PIR} ({SPIR}) and (information-theoretic) multi-server {PIR}. In this paper, we focus on exploring {SPIR}. We ﬁrst propose a simple and efﬁcient additively-homomorphic encryption scheme of which privacy is based on the learning with binary errors assumption that is known as an interesting candidate for practical lattice-based cryptography. Then, according to our proposed homomorphic encryption scheme, we give a Veriﬁable (single/multi-bit) {SPIR} ({VSPIR}) scheme for the single-query case under the malicious server model. To the best of our knowledge, our proposal is the ﬁrst practical non-interactive {VSPIR} scheme employing an efﬁcient probabilistic proof that can discover the forged result with overwhelming probability. The corresponding communication complexity and computational complexity are comparable with those of some typical {SPIR} schemes. Moreover, we extend our singlequery {VSPIR} scheme to construct a non-interactive multi-query solution. In particular, the corresponding communication complexity and computational complexity are the same as those of the single-query scheme. Finally, we provide detailed implementation results to conﬁrm efﬁciency of our proposals.},

The signature system can sign an unlimited number of messages, and the signature size increases logarithmically as a function of the number of messages signed. Signature size in a `typical' system might range from a few hundred bytes to a few kilobytes, and generation of a signature might require a few hundred to a few thousand computations of the underlying conventional encryption function.},
